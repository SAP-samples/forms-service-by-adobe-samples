## How to obtain support
In case you've a question, or otherwise need support, use the [SAP Community](https://answers.sap.com/tags/9f13aee1-834c-4105-8e43-ee442775e5ce) to get more visibility.

## Report an Issue
If you find a bug in these sample projects you are welcome to report it. We can only handle well-reported, actual bugs, so please follow the guidelines below and use forums like StackOverflow / SAP Community for support questions or when in doubt whether the issue is an actual bug. These samples are given as is and represent a good starting point for your project. We do not support any custom implemention.

### Quick Checklist for Bug Reports
Issue report checklist:
- Real, current bug
- No configuration issues
- No duplicate
- Reproducible
- Good summary
- Well-documented
- No custom development

### Requirements for a bug report
These eight requirements are the mandatory base of a good bug report:

1. Only real bugs. Do not report:
   - issues caused by application code or any code outside the samples.
   - something that behaves just different from what you expected. A bug is when something behaves different than specified. When in doubt, ask in a forum.
   - something you do not get to work properly. Use a support forum like stackoverflow to request help.
   - feature requests. Well, this is arguable: critical or easy-to-do enhancement suggestions are welcome, but we do not want to use the issue tracker as wishlist.
2. No duplicate: you have searched the issue tracker to make sure the bug has not yet been reported
3. Good summary: the summary should be specific to the issue
4. Current bug: the bug can be reproduced in the most current version (state the tested version!)
5. Reproducible bug: there are clear steps to reproduce given. This includes:
   - a URL to access the example
   - any required user/password information (do not reveal any credentials that could be mis-used!)
   - detailed and complete step-by-step instructions to reproduce the bug
6. Precise description:
   - precisely state the expected and the actual behavior
   - give information about the used browser/device and its version, if possible also the behavior in other browsers/devices
   - generally give as much additional information as possible. (But find the right balance: do not invest hours for a very obvious and easy to solve issue. When in doubt, give more information.)
7. Only one bug per report: open different tickets for different issues
